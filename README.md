# Simple linear regression with Octave

## General info
The project aim is to bring understing of linear regression into practice. </br>
It's good introduction for machine learning for beginners
</br>
It covers: 

* displaying data in Octave enviroment
* calculating cost function
* drawing regression line
* using normal equation to confirm our regression line is correct
* the last step is showing predicted values for other inputs


## Technologies
* GNU Octave, version 7.2.0
